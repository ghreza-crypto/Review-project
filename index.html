      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      <br>Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
      <br>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
      <br>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
      unchanged.
      <br>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
      <br>and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
